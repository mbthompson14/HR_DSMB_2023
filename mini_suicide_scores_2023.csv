She reported that she generally doesn't feel suicidal, but spurr of the moment decided to take too much of her medication. Once she felt the effects, she fell over. It freaked her out, so she called a friend, who then got her to the hospital. This happened last Thursday, and she reported that she was discharged yesterday (12/6/21) from the hospital. She has a follow up visit with a psychiatrist this week, and therapy starting later this month. She was also put on Lexipro and has another ""emergency"" medication for acute symptoms. She reported vaping to reduce her anxiety today because that latter medication made her feel very out of it.     I sent over the mental health resource page as soon as we talked during the depression section of the MINI. She was appreciative of those. I also discussed the option of having Jeremy reach out to her and checking in. For now, she feels fine without him reaching out because she has several psychiatrist appointments set up. She said she will reach out to us if she would like to talk to him. She repeated several times that this suicide attempt really surprised her. She had no previous intent or plan, but in a moment of feeling overwhelmed, she took too much of her medication with the intent to die. That feeling was very quickly gone, and so she called for help and was able to get to the hospital.     After talking with her, my impression is that she now has an abundance of resources to keep her safe. She also does not feel like she is in any current danger.
