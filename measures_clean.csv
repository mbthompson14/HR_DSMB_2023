She reported that she generally doesn't feel suicidal, but spurr of the moment decided to take too much of her medication. Once she felt the effects, she fell over. It freaked her out, so she called a friend, who then got her to the hospital. This happened last Thursday, and she reported that she was discharged yesterday (12/6/21) from the hospital. She has a follow up visit with a psychiatrist this week, and therapy starting later this month. She was also put on Lexipro and has another ""emergency"" medication for acute symptoms. She reported vaping to reduce her anxiety today because that latter medication made her feel very out of it.     I sent over the mental health resource page as soon as we talked during the depression section of the MINI. She was appreciative of those. I also discussed the option of having Jeremy reach out to her and checking in. For now, she feels fine without him reaching out because she has several psychiatrist appointments set up. She said she will reach out to us if she would like to talk to him. She repeated several times that this suicide attempt really surprised her. She had no previous intent or plan, but in a moment of feeling overwhelmed, she took too much of her medication with the intent to die. That feeling was very quickly gone, and so she called for help and was able to get to the hospital.     After talking with her, my impression is that she now has an abundance of resources to keep her safe. She also does not feel like she is in any current danger. I called Dr. Kendrick's office, but he was not in, so I will email him with this information and see if additional follow up is necessary. I will also contact Dr. Love and confirm whether she should be included in the study. -LCE 12/7/21    Dr. Kendrick confirmed that no further follow up is needed. -LCE 12/8/21",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-12-07 14:49:40,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,2.0,2021-12-07 14:48:35,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,20.0,2.0,,,,,2021-12-07 14:47:33,1.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,,1.0

She got into a fight with her boyfriend and took ""a bunch"" of her mother's medications. She then started to feel funny, got scared, and went to her mother. They called 911 and went to the hospital. She recognized the reason she took the pills was because she didn't have anyone to talk to. She has not had any suicide attempt and has not engaged in any self-injury since. She has a history of recurring depression and anxiety. She is not currently in a depressive episode. She is seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist regularly who she said are both great.

In the last month, he has had 3-4 instances of suicidal ideation with some specificity regarding how, but has expressed that he feels very in control and has not had any intent or plan to act on those thoughts in the last 30 days. From our discussion, my impression was that he has worked very hard to overcome this in the past, and now has good tools and resources to cope. I offered to send him mental health resources, but he declined, citing that he felt he had good access to resources if he needed them. I also asked if he wanted to have Dr. Kendrick reach out, and he declined. I called and confirmed eligibility with Dr. Love, and also sent an email to Dr. Kendrick with a copy of the MINI and a summary of our discussion.

She endorsed a few occasions of feeling hopeless and 1 occasion where a thought around suicide came into her head in the past month. She reported the suicide thought was mild and easily controlled. She reported it was likely related to her hormones. She has a history of depression and anxiety. She has seen counselors off and on over the course of years. She reported psychotherapy has been helpful for her. She recently stopped seeing a counselor because she ""covered all topics and it was getting expensive"". This RA and the participant discussed additional options for support, options for going back to therapy, warning signs if she starts to feel worse, and things she could do on her own in the meantime. She was very receptive to this discussion. She reported feeling ""safe and stable"" currently and that she felt confident she would use the resources she has if needed. This RA provided additional resources. Protective factors include her cat, friends, family, and enjoying mornings and biking. The PI was called during the visit and all relevant information was discussed. An email went to the PIs highlighting this information after the visit.

MF316AUD,baseline,123,,2.0,1.0,,9.0,1.0,2.0,"Participant PF316AUD scored a 9 (moderate) on the suicidality section of the MINI. She endorsed feeling hopeless the past month, engaging in self-injurious behavior, and making 2 suicide attempts in her lifetime.  She reported 3 episodes of depression over the course of her life. She did meet criteria for a current depressive episode although she endorsed being in a ""much better place and doing well"" compared to past years. She attempted suicide via hanging 2 years ago and via cutting in December of 2021. She reported doing much better now and not having any suicidal thoughts or ideation. She reported engaging in cutting 5 times in the past month. This RA and the participant discussed coping strategies. The participant reported music helps her and the participant and RA came up with reading, watching movies, and calling her friend to add to a list of coping strategies. The participant wrote these down and reported she would put it on a bulletin board near her bed as a reminder. The participant reported she was seeing a therapist in 2019 and it was ""very helpful"". She said she is not seeing one now because she hasn't gotten around to looking for one and she is concerned it will cost money. This RA used motivational interviewing around going back to a therapist. The patient was very receptive and reported she would like to. The patient said she was on anti-depressant medication at one point and she said it must have ""helped a lot"" because things got worse when she stopped taking it. RA and participant discussed going back to a psychiatrist. The participant was in agreement that seeing a psychiatrist would help. Protective factors include her dog, friends, and family. Additionally, she always makes sure to have at least one fun event/outing planned in the future to look forward to. She reported she has insurance and will be working full time in a week or two which will help provide additional financial support for seeing a therapist.      This RA provided the participant with national and local mental health resources. The PI was called and all relevant information was discussed. An email was sent to the relevant PIs with the MINI and a summary of the situation. One of the PIs knows resources in the area and plans to reach out to the participant to provide some further assistance.

He reported he has had thoughts about suicide and harming himself for most of his life. He described them as ""abstract"". He reported they are passing and that he does not feel a desire to act on them. Additionally, he reported he ""would never hurt himself, suicide is something (he) would never attempt again, and (he) is repulsed by the thought"". He reported he is ""in a great place in life"" and is enjoying life.
